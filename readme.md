# AI Fraud Intelligence Dashboard

## Overview

The AI Fraud Intelligence Dashboard is a sophisticated monitoring and analysis platform designed to track, analyze, and detect AI-powered fraud incidents in real-time. This dashboard provides cybersecurity professionals, fraud analysts, and decision-makers with comprehensive insights into emerging fraud trends, particularly those leveraging artificial intelligence technologies.


## Key Features

### Main Dashboard

* **Real-time Monitoring**: Automatically collects and processes data from over 40 trusted sources including cybersecurity blogs, threat intelligence feeds, and regulatory alerts.

* **Comprehensive Analytics**: Visual breakdown of fraud incidents by category, risk level, victim types, and tools/techniques.

* **Financial Impact Assessment**: Estimates financial losses from different fraud types with category-specific modeling.

* **Interactive Filtering**: Filter data by time range, risk level, and fraud categories to focus on specific areas of concern.

* **Trend Analysis**: Track the evolution of fraud patterns over time with detailed trend visualizations.

* **Detailed Incident View**: Examine individual fraud incidents with comprehensive metadata.

### Novelty Detection

* **Emerging Threat Identification**: Uses advanced AI to detect completely new types of fraud that don't match established patterns.

* **Novelty Scoring**: Assigns a 1-10 novelty score based on semantic uniqueness and vocabulary deviation from known fraud types.

* **Risk Prioritization**: Automatically assesses risk levels of novel patterns based on multiple factors.

* **Term Analysis**: Identifies and highlights emerging terminology that may indicate new fraud methodologies.

* **Alternative Classifications**: Suggests possible categorizations for novel incidents to aid in analysis.

## Technology

The dashboard leverages several advanced technologies:

* **AI Classification**: Sophisticated multi-model approach combining transformer models, zero-shot learning, and traditional ML for fraud classification.

* **Semantic Analysis**: Uses embeddings and NLP techniques to detect semantic novelty in reports.

* **Risk Profiling**: Considers victim sensitivity, tool sophistication, incident frequency, and financial impact to calculate risk scores.

* **Data Visualization**: Interactive, real-time graphs and charts powered by Plotly and Dash.

* **Dark-themed UI**: Professional, eye-friendly interface with Apple-inspired Onyx color palette.

## Data Sources

The system monitors over 40 different sources, including:

* Cybersecurity blogs and news (Krebs on Security, Dark Reading, etc.)
* Threat intelligence feeds (US-CERT, SANS Internet Storm Center)
* Official government alerts (FTC Scam Alerts, FBI News)
* AI-specific sources (AI Incident Database, OpenAI Blog)
* Academic and research publications

## Use Cases

The AI Fraud Intelligence Dashboard is designed for:

* **Security Operations Centers**: Monitor emerging threats in real-time.
* **Fraud Analysis Teams**: Identify patterns and trends in AI-enabled fraud.
* **Risk Management**: Assess and quantify financial impact of fraud types.
* **Cybersecurity Research**: Analyze novel attack vectors and techniques.
* **Compliance & Regulatory**: Track incidents for reporting requirements.

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the dashboard:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```

### Configuration

The system can be configured through the `config.json` file:

* Data collection frequency
* Database settings
* Custom data sources
* Risk assessment parameters

## Dashboard Navigation

* **Time Range Selector**: Filter data by different time periods (7 days, 30 days, 90 days, or since January 2025).
* **Category Filter**: Focus on specific fraud categories.
* **Risk Level Filter**: View only incidents matching selected risk levels.
* **Tab Navigation**: Switch between Main Dashboard and Novelty Detection views.

## Technical Requirements

* Python 3.8+ (I used 3.13 so you might have to update it)
* SQLite (default) or other database backends
* 4GB RAM recommended
* Modern web browser for UI access
